# The Arcanoid game
This repository contains the Arcanoid game code made according lessons in my [blog](https://codedoc255.wordpress.com/).

# Lessons and branching
Branch naming:
- **dev/&#42;** are development mirrors; each new feature is developed here.
   After the feature is done/ready, this branch is merged into...
- **lesson/&#42;**. These branches are dedicated to ready lessons.
   Merging these branches one by one into **master** implements features into...
- **master**. This is ready prototype; you can run it.

# Technologies used
HTML, CSS, JS. No frameworks!
